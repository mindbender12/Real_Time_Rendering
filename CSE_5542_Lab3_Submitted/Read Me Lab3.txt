Title: Blobby man controlled by keyboard and GLSL Shader
Objective: Learning GLSL, OpenGL 3.x+ advanced features, Per fragment lighting
***************************************************************************************

    Please compile the code and if you run, you will see a blobby man and the ply objets 
that you have loaded. A fixed scene is constructed that has a small building. Four types of 
primitive objects are implemented in this lab and the scene and the man is constructed using 
different scaled version of those objects. All the objects are drawn here has been created only 
once using VBO. Each object has its own VBO. Later they are just transformed and instanciated
to get multiple copies. 

   All the primitive objects are drawn at (0,0,0) initially. Though here they are initially
have unit dimension, but as per the requirements of this lab, the functions used here can 
also be used to create objects which has arbitrary length and height. The functions take 
parameter for those. 


   I am not submitting tha ply files. You can download them from the below link:
http://www.cc.gatech.edu/projects/large_models/

Implementation notes: 
**********************

    The code has been written in Visual Studio 2010 and using openGL, GLUT,
GLEW, GLM and GLSL. The primitive objects have been created manually using their geometric definitions
and added with triangles. 

   Currently you can input 6 ply files simultaneously. In order to load them, you have to input them from the
command line argument of Visual Studio. If you want to load bunny and happy, then you add "bunny.ply happy.ply" 
at the command line argument. Then compile and run the code.

//////////////
//  Note:-  //
/////////////

    I have tried almost all the ply files and all of them worked. Some of the files have very large dimensions 
so it might be a good idea to not to use those. If you use those then you have to zoom out using mouse to see them.
So, try bunny,happy,apple,dragon files. They have almost similar diemnsions. I am attaching a output screen, how it
will look like if u load 3 plys at the same time. 


GLSL Features implemented: 
****************************
   As required, Per fragment Phong Illumination model has been implemented in this code using GLSL. All the matrix manipulation 
in this code has been done using GLM library and no openGL fixed functions are being used. I have also implemented several
other shaders that Prof. Shen discussed in class. Four different shader models have been added to the code (press 's' to switch 
between different shaders). 

  1. Per Fragment Phong Illuminaton (Lighting in frag shader)
  2. Per Vertex Phong Illumination (lighting in vert shader)
  3. Toon Shading / Cel Shading (Lighting in frag shader, this one has one light)
  4. Flat shading  (Lighting in frag shader)
  
  
  There are low lights in the model. You can turn them on/off by pressing
  'o' for first light and 'p' for second light. If both lights are turned off then
  user can only see the ambient color. 


   The blobby man visible in the scene can be controlled using several keys, as per the requirements.
You can control the blobby man using following keys:

    f: move the man forward.

    b: move the man backward.

    t: turn the man counter clockwise by 15 degrees

    T: turn the man clock wise by 15 degree

    l: lift the left arm

    r: lift the right arm   

    h: rotate the head clockwise 15 degree (new feature added)
   
    H: rotate the head anti-clockwise 15 degree (new feature added)


********************************************************************************
Other special Key features: 
********************************************************************************

  1. s = switch between different shaders. Check the cmd window to know which shader is currently being shown.
  2. w = swtich between wireframe / solid lighting mode
  3. c = change ply objets colors randomly
  4. o = turn off/on first light
  5. p = turn off/on second light
  6. Press up/down/left/right arrow keys to look around by moving the camera direction.
  7. Changing the view direction and other flexibility: Using mouse left button you can rotate the scene 
    and while pressing right mouse button, you can drag the mouse to zoom in or zoom out.
