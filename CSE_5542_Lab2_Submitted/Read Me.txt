Title: Blobby man controlled by keyboard
Objective: Learning VBO and hierarchical transformation
***************************************************************************************


    Please compile the code and if you run, you will see a blobby man standing at origin.
A fixed scene is constructed that has a small hut and two trees. Four types of primitive
objects are implemented in this lab and the scene and the man is constructed using different
scaled version of those objects. All the objects are drawn here has been created only once 
using VBO. Each object has its own VBO. Later they are just transformed and instanciated
to get multiple copies. 

   All the primitive objects are drawn at (0,0,0) initially. Though here they are initially
have unit dimension, but as per the requirements of this lab, the functions used here can 
also be used to create objects which has arbitrary length and height. The functions take 
parameter for those. 


**********************
Implementation notes: 
**********************


    The whole code has been written in Visual Studio 2010 and using openGL, GLUT,
GLEW and GLM. The primitive objects have been created manually using their geometric definitions
and added with triangles. 


The blobby man visible in the scene can be controlled using several keys, as per the requirements.
You can control the blobby man using following keys:

    f: move the man forward.

    b: move the man backward.

    t: turn the man counter clockwise by 15 degrees

    T: turn the man clock wise by 15 degree

    l: lift the left arm

    r: lift the right arm   

    h: rotate the head clockwise 15 degree (new feature added)
   
    H: rotate the head anti-clockwise 15 degree (new feature added)



Extra features I added to make the scene and interaction more flexible and nice: 
**********************************************************************************


1.  Smooth shading and proper lighting has been added to it as an extra addition on top
    of the original requirements of the lab.


2.  Changing the view direction and other flexibility: Using mouse left button you can rotate the scene 
    and while pressing right mouse button, you can drag the mouse to zoom in or zoom out.  


3.  If you change the screen size, the objects will maintain their proper aspect ratio too.
