Title: Shadow map, Bump map, Transparency, Glossyness, Lens effect
Objective: Learning GLSL Texture map, OpenGL 3.x+ advanced features, Per fragment lighting

   Please go to http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~duttas/Images_5542/RT_rendering.html for additional resources and texture files used here.
   I am not submitting tha ply files. You can download them from the below link:
http://www.cc.gatech.edu/projects/large_models/

In order to run the code you must at least load one ply file. 


**********************
Implementation notes: 
**********************

    The code has been written in Visual Studio 2010 and using openGL, GLUT,
GLEW, GLM and GLSL. The primitive objects have been created manually using their geometric definitions
and added with triangles. 

   In order to load them, you have to input them from the
command line argument of Visual Studio. If you want to load bunny and happy, then you add "bunny.ply happy.ply" 
at the command line argument. Then compile and run the code.

//  Note:-  //

  1. All the texture images used in this code has fixed dimension 512x512. I have used PPM files. I am attaching the 
image files for your convenience. The texture files should have the exact same name. So, if you want to load different
texture files they have to be renamed exactly the same as attached here and should have 512x512 dimension.

File names for Cube map: 

positive_x.ppm
negative_x.ppm
positive_y.ppm
negative_y.ppm
positive_z.ppm
negative_z.ppm

Other texture files used:

marbleTexture.ppm
piller.ppm
tiles.ppm
bumpNormal.ppm

  2.I have tried almost all the ply files and all of them worked. Some of the files have very large dimensions 
so it might be a good idea to not to use those. If you use those then you have to zoom out using mouse to see them.
So, try bunny,happy,apple,dragon files. They have almost similar diemnsions. 


***************press 's' to switch between different shaders************************

   
    The blobby man visible in the scene can be controlled using several keys, as per the requirements.
You can control the blobby man using following keys:

    f: move the man forward.

    b: move the man backward.

    t: turn the man counter clockwise by 15 degrees

    T: turn the man clock wise by 15 degree

    l: lift the left arm

    r: lift the right arm   

    h: rotate the head clockwise 15 degree (new feature added)
   
    H: rotate the head anti-clockwise 15 degree (new feature added)


********************************************************************************
Other special Key features: 
********************************************************************************

  1. s = switch between different shaders. Check the cmd window to know which shader is currently being shown.
  2. w = swtich between wireframe / solid lighting mode
  3. c = change ply objets colors randomly
  4. Press up/down/left/right arrow keys to look around by moving the camera direction.
  5. Changing the view direction and other flexibility: Using mouse left button you can rotate the scene 
    and while pressing right mouse button, you can drag the mouse to zoom in or zoom out.
