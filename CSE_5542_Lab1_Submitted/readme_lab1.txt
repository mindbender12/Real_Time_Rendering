This code is written in MS Visual Studio 2010 using openGL and GLUT.

How to run: Open the project file (.vcproj) and load the project. Change the necessary 
project properties to include the library files. Compile and run. You might have to copy the freeglut.dll file in project directory.
I am uploading the file in case you do not have it. If you face any trouble running this code please let me know. 

For bonus point: I have tried to add the flexibility of window resizing.
