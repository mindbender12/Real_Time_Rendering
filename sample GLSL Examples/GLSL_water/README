Info

While studying other techniques I put everything aside and start 
working on this demo full-time for some days.
full-time for some days.
This is based on Riemer's XNA Water Technique 
(http://www.riemers.net/eng/Tutorials/XNA/Csharp/Series4/The_water_technique.php),
it's not optimized in any way and very lazy in scene handling but it works. :-)


Controls
--------

Escape,q - to quit the program
F1 - to switch between windowed mode/full screen
1,2,3,4 - refraction pass/reflection pass/without water/with water
SPACE - to toggle light movement
R - to toggle camera rotation
KP7,KP8,KP9 - to decrease/reset/increase water level
KP4,KP5,KP6 - to decrease/reset/increase wave length
KP1,KP2,KP3 - to decrease/reset/increase wave height
KP0 - to reset everything


Compiling
---------
In order to compile the program you have to use SCons.
Should you have any problem with includes or libs, tweak it to suit your needs.


Note
----
The brick room is rendered with parallax mapping.
