GL3_parallax_DoF: Parallax mapping and DoF effect with a GL3 compliant class library
Copyright (C) 2008 Angelo "Encelo" Theodorou


Info
----
This demo is the first one using a C++ class library, it shows parallax mapping and depth of field together.
The classes are very close to be GL3 (and ES2) compliant, this actually means that I don't use the fixed pipeline at all: 
I handle matrices by myself and pass every information to shaders directly, with no use of OpenGL built-in state variables.
Stanford PLY mesh loading comes as a little bonus. ;-)


Controls
--------
Escape,q - to quit the program
F1 - to switch between windowed mode/full screen
space - to start/stop cubes movement along the z-axis
r - to start/stop MrFixit's head rotation
l - to start/stop light movement along the x-axis
p - to print current DoF parameter values
KP7,KP8,KP9 - to decrease/reset/increase focal distance
KP4,KP5,KP6 - to decrease/reset/increase focal range
KP0 - to reset everything
1,2,3,4,5 - to put the nth cube in focus


Compiling
---------
In order to compile the program you have to use SCons.
Should you have any problem with includes or libs, tweak it to suit your needs.
